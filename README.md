# pro-cert-notes.github.io
Source repository for the pro-cert-notes GitHub Pages site. The site is a static blog generated by Jekyll (the default engine supported by GitHub Pages) from Markdown content.

## Repository layout
- `_config.yml` — site-wide configuration (site title, build settings).
- `_posts/` — blog posts in Jekyll’s post format: `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`.
- `index.md` — home page content/front matter.
- `about.md` — About page content/front matter.

## Content model
Posts are Markdown files with YAML front matter. Jekyll converts them into dated permalinks (e.g. `/YYYY/MM/DD/slug.html`) and renders lists of posts on the home page.

## Build & deployment
This repo is an organization/user site (`<org>.github.io`), so GitHub Pages publishes directly from the repository root on the default branch. Pushing commits updates the live site after Pages rebuilds.

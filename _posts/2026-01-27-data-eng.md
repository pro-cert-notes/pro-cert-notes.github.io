Financial services has always been data-driven, but the nature of “useful data” has changed. Banks, insurers, fintechs and investment firms still rely on core internal sources: transactions, customer onboarding, market feeds and financial statements, but those datasets are increasingly commoditised. The competitive edge now comes from combining traditional data with external signals, doing it safely, and being able to defend decisions when challenged. That’s why knowledge of cybersecurity, OSINT (open-source intelligence) and the ability to process alternative datasets is a major advantage for a data engineer in financial services.

Start with the reality of risk. Financial organisations are prime targets for cybercrime and fraud, and they operate under tight governance expectations. data engineers sit right in the blast zone: if pipelines are insecure, attackers can tamper with data, exfiltrate sensitive information, or poison models and detection systems. A data engineer with strong cybersecurity literacy designs for secure-by-default ingestion and storage: encrypting data in transit and at rest, enforcing least-privilege access, separating environments, rotating credentials, and implementing robust monitoring. Just as importantly, they build pipelines that preserve integrity: checksums, immutable logs, and controls that make it obvious if data has been altered. In a world of adversarial behaviour, “correct” data isn’t just about accuracy, it’s about trust.

OSINT knowledge complements this. OSINT is not a buzzword for “scraping the internet”; it’s a disciplined approach to collecting and interpreting publicly available information with attention to provenance, ethics, and constraints such as licensing and terms of use. In financial services, OSINT can provide early indicators that internal data won’t show until it’s too late: adverse media on directors, signs of a business shutting down, emerging scam campaigns, domain impersonation, breach disclosures, or abnormal chatter around vulnerabilities and exploits. data engineers who understand OSINT can help their organisations avoid common pitfalls: collecting the wrong thing, collecting too much, or failing to capture the context needed to use it responsibly.

Then there’s alternative data: datasets that sit outside standard financial feeds. Think corporate registries, shipping and logistics signals, job postings, app reviews, web traffic trends, satellite-derived indicators, device telemetry (where permitted), or supplier risk information. Used well, these sources can sharpen credit risk models, strengthen fraud detection, support AML investigations, and improve operational risk monitoring. Used poorly, they create noise, bias, and compliance headaches. The data engineer who can evaluate, ingest, normalise and validate these sources, while tracking lineage and versioning, makes them usable at scale.

What makes this combination truly powerful is the ability to connect the dots. Financial crime and cyber-enabled fraud are rarely visible in a single table. You may need to link a customer to a business entity, to a domain registration, to a cluster of IP addresses, to a series of marketplace listings, to an adverse media mention, and then back to transactions. That’s entity resolution across messy, inconsistent sources. Engineers with OSINT and cybersecurity awareness anticipate aliasing, shell structures, transliteration issues and deliberate obfuscation, and they design pipelines that support probabilistic matching, confidence scoring, and explainable links rather than brittle “exact match” joins.

Finally, cybersecurity thinking and OSINT discipline improve auditability and defensibility. In financial services, decisions can be reviewed by internal risk committees, external auditors, regulators, and customers. data engineers who build governed pipelines:clear data contracts, retention policies, reproducible transformations, and evidence-grade logging, enable faster investigations and fewer unpleasant surprises. When an alert is raised or a model output is questioned, the team can answer: Where did this data come from? Who touched it? What changed? Can we reproduce the result?

In short, cybersecurity knowledge protects the pipeline, OSINT knowledge enriches it, and alternative data capability differentiates it. Together, they turn a data engineer from a builder of plumbing into an enabler of trusted, timely insight. Exactly what modern financial services competes on.
